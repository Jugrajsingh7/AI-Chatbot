A keylogger is a program that records keystrokes made by a user on a computer without their knowledge. It can be used for various purposes, including monitoring user activity, debugging applications, or even in some cases, malicious intent (although such use is highly discouraged and often illegal).

Features:
Records all keystrokes made by the user.
Logs the timestamp of each keystroke for chronological tracking.
Stores the captured data locally in a text file for later analysis.
